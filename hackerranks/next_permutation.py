# Given a list of numbers,
# Return the same list rearranged into the lexicographically next greater permutation. Ex: [1, 3, 2] -> [2, 1, 3]
#   If such an arrangement is not possible (list already lexicographically greatest order), then return lowest order
#       Ex: [3, 2, 1] -> [1, 2, 3]
# The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.
