# Given 1000 sets/arrays ("bags") of 1000 strings each and a target string
# Return a set of bags that potentially contain the target string (sublinear function)
#   Use Bloom Filter data structure (probabilistic data structure)
#   (https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-adv-system-design-intvw/g2NrQEKn463)
# Write code to generate 1000 bags with 1000 random strings each
# Write tests to demonstrate functionality of code
